A *Grid* is a simplified lattice. Think of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ as a lattice with base $\{ 1,i \}$. Linear combinations of elements in the base give a space that fills the plane of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$. This grid is given by the set $\{ mz+nw:m,n\in\mathbb{Z}, z,w\in\mathbb{Z}[i] \}$.
## Minkowski
Consider a grid of parallelograms and a circle centered at the origin. If the area of the circle is 4 times the area of a parallelogram, then the circle contains at least 1 other grid point than the origin.
