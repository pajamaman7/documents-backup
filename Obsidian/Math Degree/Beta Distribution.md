The Beta Distribution is one that simply follows two shape parameters: $\alpha, \beta$. It is always only continuous on $[0,1]$. This distribution proves helpful for proportion based questions.

The [[Probability Density Function]] is given by: 
$$f(x|\alpha,\beta) =\frac{x^{\alpha-1}(1-x)^{\beta-1}}{\mathrm{B}(\alpha,\beta)} $$
Where $B$ is the [[Beta Function]].

The [[Expected Value]]:
$$\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}$$
The [[Variance and Standard Deviation]]:
$$\frac{\alpha\beta}{(\alpha+\beta)^{2}(\alpha+\beta+1)}$$
