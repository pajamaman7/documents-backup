Let $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be a closed and bounded subset. Suppose $\varphi:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^n$ is such that:
- $\varphi(E)=E$, $E$ is invariant under $\varphi$.
- $\exists 0<k<1: \varphi(b)-\varphi(a)\leq k\| b-1 \|$ , $\varphi$ is a contraction.
Then for any $x^{0}$ in $E$, the sequence $\{ x^{k} \}_{k\geq 0}$ defined by $x^{k+1}=\varphi(x^{k})$ is [[Convergence of Sequences|Convergent]], and its limit $x=\lim\limits_{ k \to \infty }x^{k}$ satisfies $\varphi(x)=x$. Furthermore, $x$ is unique in $E$.
