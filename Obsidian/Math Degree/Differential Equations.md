First order differential equations contain only the first derivative of the dependent variable. 
Different types of FODEs include:
## Ordinary Differential Equations
### First order Differential Equations
[[Forms of FODEs]]
- [[Linear Differential Equations]] - $y'+p(x)y=f(x)$
- [[Separable First Order Differential Equations]] - $N(y)\frac{dy}{dx}=M(x)$
- [[Exact Differential Equations]] - $M(x,y)+N(x,y)\frac{dy}{dx}=0$
- [[Bernoulli Differential Equations]] - $y'+yp(x)=y^nf(x)$
- [[First Order Differential Equations Using Substitutions]] - ???
- [[First Order Homogenous Differential Equations]]
