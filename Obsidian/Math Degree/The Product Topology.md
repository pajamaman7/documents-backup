If $X,Y$ are [[Topology|Topological Spaces]], there is a topology defined on $X\times Y$ generated by the basis $\mathcal{B}=\{ U\times V :U \text{ is open in }X,V\text{ is open in }Y\}$
## Theorem
If $A$ is a subspace of $X$ and $B$ is a subspace of $Y$, the the topology inherited from the product $A\times B$ is identical to the topology inherited from [[The Subspace Topology]] $A\times B\subseteq X\times Y$
