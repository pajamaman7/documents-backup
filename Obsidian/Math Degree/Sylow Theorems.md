## First Sylow Theorem
If $G$ is a [[Groups|Group]] with order $mp^{k}$ where $p$ is prime and $p\not\mid m$, then $G$ has a subgroup of order $p^{k}$ In fact, it has a subgroup of every order dividing $p^{k}$.
Such a subgroup is called a Sylow $p$-group.
## Second Sylow Theorem
If $H\leq G$ is a Sylow $p$-group of order $p$, any other subgroup $K$ of the same order must have $K=gHg^{-1}$ for some $g\in G$.
## Third Sylow Theorem
Let $n_{p}$ denote the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of a group $G$, with $|G|=p^{n}m$. Then:
- $n_p\equiv {1}\pmod{p}$
- $n_p|m$
- $n_p=[G:N(P)]$, where $P$ is any Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$.
