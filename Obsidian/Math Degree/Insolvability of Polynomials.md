When can you write the roots of a polynomial $f$ in a [[Fields|Field]] $F$ in terms of radicals of its coefficients? If we can, we say $f$ is solvable over $F$.
## Galois' Criterion
If $F$ has $char F=0$, then $f\in F[x]$ is solvable$\iff$ its [[Galois Theory|Galois Group]] is [[Solvable Groups|Solvable]].
