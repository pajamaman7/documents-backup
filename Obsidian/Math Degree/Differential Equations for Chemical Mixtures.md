A substance is pumped into a continuously stirred container at rate $r_i$, concentration $c_o$ and out at rate $r_o$, concentration $c_o$. The container is supposed to start with volume $v_0$. This gives the DE:

$$\begin{cases} x'=c_ir_i-c_or_o \\ x(0)=x_0
 \end{cases}$$
 With $$c_0=\frac{x}{v_0+t(r_i-r_0)}$$
