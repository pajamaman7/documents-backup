A covering $p:\tilde{X}\to X$ is a continuous map and space $\tilde{X}$, for each $a\in X$ there exists $a\in U$ open with $\bigsqcup_{\alpha}U_\alpha=p ^{-1}(U)$ for disjoint open $U_\alpha$. 
Then $p:U_\alpha \to U$ is a homeomorphism.
## Lifting
If $\tilde{X},X,p$ are as above, we have a lifting of any homotopy ${F}:X\to Y$, which is a homotopy $\tilde{F}:X\to Y$. In the same way we may lift loops in $X$ to loops in $\tilde{X}$.
## Fundamental Group
If $\tilde{X}\to X$ is a covering, then $\pi_{1}(\tilde{X})\to\pi_{1}(X)$ is [[One-to-One|Injective]].
In a sense, covering spaces each correspond to a [[Groups|Subgroup]] $H\subseteq \pi_{1}(X)$.
## Universal Cover
If $X$ is [[Path-Connected]] and locally [[Simply-Connected]], then there exists some $\tilde{X}$ covering space of $X$, so that $\pi_{1}(\tilde{X})=\{ e \}$ . Such a cover is called a universal cover.
## Equivalence
If $p_{1}:X_{1}\to X$ and $p_{2}: X_{2}\to X$ are covering maps, they are said to be equivalent if there exists a homeomorphism $f:X_{1}\to X_{2}$ which commutes, $fp_{2}=p_{1}$, and which maintains basepoint. 
If this is satisfied we have:
$$
p_{1*}(\pi_{1}(Y_{1}))=p_{2*}(\pi_{1}(Y_{2}))
$$
If the map $f$ does not preserve basepoint, these will be conjugate subgroups of $\pi_{1}(x)$
