A [[Measure|Measurable Space]] is one which has a $\sigma$-algebra defined on it, and therefore can have a measure defined on it.
A [[Measure Space]] is a tuple $(X,\mathcal{E},\mu)$ of a space, $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{E}$ and a measure $\mu$.
## Measure
A positive measure is a function $\mu$ defined on a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathfrak{R}$, whose range is in $[0,\infty]$, and is countably additive; if $\{ A_i \}$ is a disjoint countable collection of members of $\mathfrak{R}$, then
$$\mu \left(  \bigcup\limits_{i=1 }^{\infty}\right)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\mu(A_i)$$
