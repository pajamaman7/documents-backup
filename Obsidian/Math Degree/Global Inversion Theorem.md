Let $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^n$ be in $C^{1}(\Omega)$ for some $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$. if $f$ is [[One-to-One]] in $\Omega$, and $df(x)$ is invertible for every $x\in\Omega$, then 
-  $V=f(\Omega)$ is open in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
- $f$ is invertible as a function from $\Omega$ to $V$.
- The inverse $g$ for $f$ is in $C^{1}(V)$, and $Jg(f(x))Jf(x)=I$.
A function as above is called a Diffeomorphism
