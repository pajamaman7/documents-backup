A Geometric series is one where the ratio between $a_{n}$ and $a_{n+1}$ is constant. If this ratio is less than 1, then the series converges. If not, it diverges. This is aptly called the "ratio." If this series converges when taken to infinity, the infinite sum is given by:
Also note that the first term is given by $a$.
$$S_{n}= \frac{a}{1-r}$$
Another note is that $r$ can be found with:
$$r= \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}$$
