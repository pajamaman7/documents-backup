A [[Functions|Function]] from a [[Measure|Measurable]] space $X$ to $\mathbb{C}$, $f:X\to\mathbb{C}$, is said to be measurable if $f(X)$ is finite, $f$ takes a finite number of values over $X$.
## Theorem
Let $f:X\to [0,\infty)$ be measurable. Then: 
- There exist simple measurable $0\leq s_{1} \leq s_{2}\leq \dots \leq f$
- $s_n\to f$ as $n\to \infty$.
Generally, we might say that any measurable function can be approximated by simple functions.
