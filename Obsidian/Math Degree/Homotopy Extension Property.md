Suppose that $A\subseteq X$ a subset of a [[Topology|Topological Space]] is given along with a [[Continuity|Continuous]] map $f_{0}:X\to Y$, and a [[Homotopy]] $f_t:A\to Y$ of $f_0|_A$. If the pair $(X,A)$ is such that any such map can be extended to a homotopy $X\to Y$, then $(X,A)$ is said to have the Homotopy Extension Property (HEP).
## Lemma
A pair $(X,A)$ has the homotopy extension property if and only if $X\times \{ 0 \}\cup A\times I$ is a retract of $X\times I$.
## Lemma
If $(X,A)$ has HEP, then $(X\times I,A\times I)$ also has HEP
## Lemma
If $(X,A)$ has HEP and $A$ is contractible, then $\pi:X\to X/ A$ is a homotopy equivalence
## Prop
If $(X,A) ,(Y,A)$ both have $HEP$, and $f:X\to Y$ is a homotopy equivalence with $f|_A=id_A$, then there exists some $g:Y\to X$, constant on $A$, with homotopies $fg\simeq id$ and $gf\simeq id$.
### Corollary
If $A\subseteq X$ has the HEP and and the inclusion is a homotopy equivalence, then there is a [[Deformation Retraction]] from $X$ to $A$. In particular, $i$ is inclusion of deformation retract.
## Examples
- The pair $(D^{n},S^{n-1})$ has the HEP
- If $X$ is a [[Countable and Uncountable sets|Finite]] [[CW Complex]], and $A$ is a finite subcomplex, then $(X,A)$ has the Homotopy Extension Property
