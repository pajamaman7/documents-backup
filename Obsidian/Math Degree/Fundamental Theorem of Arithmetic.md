The Fundamental theorem of arithmetic, or FTA, states that each natural number can be written as the product of distinct [[Primes]], each raised to a natural power. Or, "Every natural number can be written as a product of [[Primes]] in a unique way, up to order."

So, for any $n\in\mathbb{Z},$ we can write:
$$n=\pm p_{1}^{\alpha_{1}}p_{2}^{\alpha_{2}}\dots p_r^{\alpha_r}$$
for distinct $p_i$s and all $\alpha_i\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$.
### For divisors
If $d$ [[divides]] $n$ with $n$ as above, we can write:
$$d=p_{1}^{e_1}p_{2}^{e_2}\dots p_r^{e_r}$$
for all $p_i$ as above and all $0\leq e_i\leq\alpha_i$.
