The Taylor Series of a function is an infinite degree polynomial that can represent the function. The Taylor Series, like a [[Power Series]], is centered at some value $a$. 

A [[List of Taylor Series]] may prove helpful for certain common functions.

The Taylor series of a function can be found with the following formula:

$$\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}a}{n!}(x-a)^n$$
Where $f^{(n)}(a)$ is the $n$th derivative of $f(x)$ at $a$. 
Also note that a McLaurin series is just a Taylor series centered at 0.
