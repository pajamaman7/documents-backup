A Relation between two sets is a subset of the [[Cartesian Product]] of those two sets.
So, all [[Functions]] are relations.

## Properties of Relations
For the following definitions, suppose $R$ is a relation from $A \to A$. 
- $R$ is reflexive $\iff$ $\forall x\in A, xRx$
- $R$ is symmetric $\iff$ $\forall x,y \in A,$ if $xRy,$ then $yRx$.
- $R$ is antisymmetric $\iff$ $\forall x,y \in A,$ if $xRy$ and $yRx$, then $y=x$
- $R$ is transitive $\iff$ $\forall x,y,z \in A$, if $xRy$ and $yRz$, then $xRz$.
