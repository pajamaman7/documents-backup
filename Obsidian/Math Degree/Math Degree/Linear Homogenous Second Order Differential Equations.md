What a name. [[Differential Equations]] of this variety take the form:
$$ay''+by'+cy=0$$
Finding the roots of an equation $p(r)$ will give us our solution.
$$p(r)=ar^2+br+c=0$$ 
The solution can take a variety of forms, depending on the roots of $p(r)$

## Distinct real roots
If the roots ($r_1,r_2$) are distinct and real, the solution $y(x)$ is given by:
$$y(x)=c_1e^{r_1x}+c_2e^{r_2x}$$
where $c_1, c_2$ are any real numbers.
## Complex roots
If the roots $(a+bi,a-bi)$ are complex, the solution is given by: 
$$y(x)=c_1e^{ax}\cos(bx)+c_2e^{ax}\sin(bx)$$
## Repeated Roots
If there is only one root with multiplicity $2$, then the solution is given by:
$$y(x)=c_1e^{rx}+c_2xe^{rx}$$
