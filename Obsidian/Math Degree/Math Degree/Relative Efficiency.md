Efficiency is a measure of how many observations are required for an estimator to perform well. We do this by comparing two estimators, $\hat{\theta}_1, \hat{\theta}_2$, which both estimate $\theta$.
$$eff(\hat{\theta}_1,\hat{\theta}_2)=RE(\hat{\theta}_1,\hat{\theta}_2)=\frac{MSE(\hat{\theta}_1)}{MSE(\hat{\theta}_2)}$$
If efficiency is less than 1, $\hat{\theta}_1$ is a more efficient estimator.
