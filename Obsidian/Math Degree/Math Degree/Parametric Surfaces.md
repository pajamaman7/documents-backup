The range of a function $\vec{r}:D\to \mathbb{R}^3$ with $D\subset \mathbb{R}^{2}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and is called a *Parametric surface*. 
## Functionally
Consider the surface $S$ as a piece of a function $z=f(x,y)$, from some $D\subset \mathbb{R}^{2}$. Then we can parameterize $S$ by:
$$S=\begin{pmatrix}
x\\y\\f(x,y) 
\end{pmatrix}$$
## Implicit
For implicitly defined functions such as the intersection of different equations or shapes like a sphere, it may be more difficult to parameterize surfaces.
## Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates
We can use [[Spherical Coordinates]] or [[Cylindrical Coordinates]] to parameterize. 
- Cylindrical: We typically use $r,\theta$ as our independent variables. $z=\vec{r}(r,\theta)$
- Spherical: Typically we keep $r$ constant so we have $\vec{r}(\theta,\varphi)$.
## Tangent plane
The tangent plane to a surface $S$ at a point $u_{0},v_{0}$ can be defined by $\vec r_u(u_{0},v_{0}), \vec r_v(u_{0},v_{0})$, which [[Span]] the plane.
The normal to this plane is given by $\vec r_u\times \vec r_v$.
If $S$ is functionally defined then the normal vector is given by: 
$$\vec{n}=\begin{pmatrix}

\end{pmatrix}$$
