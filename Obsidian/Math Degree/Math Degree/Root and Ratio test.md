(From [[Convergence tests]])
For some series with general term $a_n$, we can find a value L through two different formulas:
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right | = L = \sqrt[n]{\left | a_n\right |}$$
If $L<1$ , the series is absolutely convergent. If $L=0$, the test is inconclusive. If $L>1$, then the series is divergent.
Note that this test attempts to check if the series behaves geometrically. If so, $L$ will equal the ratio between two terms.
