## Vectors
Let $\{v_{1},v_{2},\dots ,v_{m}\}$ be a set of $m$ [[Vectors]] in $\mathbb{R}^n$. A linear

## Functions
Let $\{f_{1}(t),f_{2}(t)\dots f_{m}(t)\}$ be a set of $m$ [[Functions]] defined on some interval $I$. 
A linear combination of the $m$ functions is an expression of the form $c_{1}f_{1}(t)+c_{2}f_{2}(t)+\dots+ c_{m}f_{m}(t)$.
### Linear Dependence for functions
The set of functions above is said to be [[Linear Dependence|Linearly Independent]] on $I$ if there exists scalars $c_{1},c_{2}\dots c_m\in\mathbb{R}$, not all zero so that $c_{1}f_{1}(t)+c_{2}f_{2}(t)+\dots+ c_{m}f_{m}(t)=0$.

However if the linear combination of these functions is always nonzero (for nonzero constants), then the set of functions is said to be Linearly Independent

We can also use the [[Wronskian]] test for linear Independence.
Let $h_{1}(t),h_{2}(t)\dots h_n(t)$ be solutions to a [[Linear nth Order Differential Equations]]
