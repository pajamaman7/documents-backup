Let $N\trianglelefteq G$ for some [[Groups|Group]] $G$, and consider the set 
$$G /N=\{ gN:g\in G \}$$
We define the operation on this set, $(aN)*(bN)=abN$, which makes this set a group.
If $G$ is finite, $|G /N| =[G:N]=\frac{|G|}{|N|}$
## Theorems
- There is a natural onto [[Group Homomorphism and Isomorphism|Homomorphism]]: $\varphi:G\to G /N$ given by $gN$
- If $G$ is abelian, so is $G /N$
- If $G$ is cyclic, so is $G /N$. $\left< g \right>= G\implies G /N= \left< gN \right>$
- For some $K\leq G$, if $G /K$ is cyclic $\implies$ $G$ is abelian
