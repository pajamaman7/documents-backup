A [[Vectors|Vector]] subspace $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a [[Subset]] of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ so that:
1. $0\in u$
2. If $x,y\in U$, then $x+y\in U$.
3. If $z\in U$, then $az\in U$ for any $a\in\mathbb{R}$.
## Null Space
A null space of some $m\times n$ [[Matrices|Matrix]] $A$ is denoted and defined by:
$$null\,A=\{ x \in\mathbb{R}^{n}: Ax=0 \}$$
Hence, the set of all the vectors that are transformed to the zero vector after multiplication by $A$.
This is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
## Image Space
The image space of some $m\times n$ matrix $A$ is denoted and defined by:
$$\mathrm{im} (A)=\{ Ax : x \in \mathbb{R}^{n} \}$$
Hence, the set of all vectors obtained by matrix multiplication by $A$.
This is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{m}$.
