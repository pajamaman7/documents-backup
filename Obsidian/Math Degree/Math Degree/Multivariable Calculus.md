Multivariable Calculus is the extension of study of calculus of single variable functions to systems of multiple independent variables.
Important topics include: 
- [[Partial Differentiation]]
- [[Multiple Integrals]]
Some principles from [[Linear Algebra]] may prove helpful throughout the study of multivariable calculus.
