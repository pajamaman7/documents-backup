The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that the area under the curve of a function between two points $a,b$ is equal to the [[Antidifferentiation|Antiderivative]] of the function at b minus its antiderivative at a.
So, for some function $f(x)$ with an antiderivative $F(x)$,
$$\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx=F(b)-F(a)$$
Note that $a, b$ can be constants, flipping $a,b$ will give a negative value, and when integration bounds are infinite we can use [[Improper Integrals]]. As well, in general,
$$\int_{0}^{t}f(x)dx=F(t)-F(0)$$
For some parameter $t$.
