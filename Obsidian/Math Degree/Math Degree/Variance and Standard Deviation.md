Variance and Standard deviation, in [[Statistics]], is a measure of how far from the [[Expected Value]] results of an experiments will fall.

Variance is calculated for a random variable $X$ as
$$V[X]=E[X^2]-E[X]^2=E[X-E[X]^2]$$
Standard deviation is simply the positive square root of the variance.
$$SD[X]=\sigma_X=\sqrt{V[X]}$$
## Additional Rules
Let $c$ be a constant. Then:

$$V[c]=0$$
$$V[cX]=c^2V[X]$$
