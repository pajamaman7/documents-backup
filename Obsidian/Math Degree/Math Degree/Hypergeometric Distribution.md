A Hypergeometric Probability Distribution is one where $n$ objects are chosen from a total of $N$ objects. Out of these $N$ objects, $r$ are known to be successes.

The [[Probability Mass Function]]:
$$P(X=x)=\frac{\binom{r}{x}\binom{N-r}{n-\chi}}{\binom{N}{n}}$$
The [[Expected Value]]: 
$$\mu=\frac{nr}{N}$$
The [[Variance and Standard Deviation]]:
$$\sigma^2=n\left({\frac{r}{N}}\right)\left({\frac{N-r}{N}}\right)\left({\frac{N-n}{N-1}}\right)$$
