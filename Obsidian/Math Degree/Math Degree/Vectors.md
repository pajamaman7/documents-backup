Vectors represent quantities that cannot be expressed by one number, or quantities that exist in multiple dimensions. 
$$\overrightarrow v =\begin{bmatrix} 1&0&0 \end{bmatrix}^{T}=\begin{bmatrix} 1\\0\\0 \end{bmatrix}$$
        (In $\mathbb{R}^3$), this can represent a vector with magnitude $1$ in the $x$-direction and $0$ in $y,z$.
