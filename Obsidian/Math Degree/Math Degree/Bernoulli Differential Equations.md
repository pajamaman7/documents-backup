Bernoulli [[Differential Equations]] take the following form:
$$y'+yp(x)=f(x)y^n$$where $n\not\in\{0,1\}$. We solve these using a substitution $v=y^{1-n}$, which also gives $v'=y'y^{-n}{(1-n)}$. So our original equation will become:
$$\frac{v'}{1-n}+p(x)v=f(x)$$
which we can solve using the techniques in [[Linear Differential Equations]].
