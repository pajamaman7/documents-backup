A binary operation $*$ on a set $A$ is a mapping from any pair $a,b\in A$ to some other element $c$ in $A$.
All [[Groups]] have a binary operation.

Examples of binary operations include subtraction, addition, multiplication, division.

## Associativity
If $*$ is a binary operation on $A$, $*$ is associative if and only if $a*(b*c)=(a*b)*c$.
## Commutativity
If $*$ is a binary operation on $A$, $*$ is commutative if and only if $a*b=b*a$.
