In [[Hypothesis Testing]], the goodness of a test is measured by $\alpha,\beta$, the probabilities of type I and II error respectively. The power of a test is $1-\beta$ and is a measure of how often we expect to reject the null hypothesis correctly.
### Simple Hypothesis Testing
A hypothesis test is said to be simple if that hypothesis uniquely specifies the distribution of the population from which the sample is taken. E.g. the hypothesis $H_a: \lambda=2$ is a simple hypothesis.
## Process
This process works with simple null hypotheses. Let $L(\theta)$ denote the likelihood of the sample when the parameter is $\theta$.
For some $\alpha$, the test that maximizes the power at $\theta_a$ has a rejection region RR given at $\frac{L(\theta_0)}{L(\theta_a)}<k$, where $k$ is our critical value.
