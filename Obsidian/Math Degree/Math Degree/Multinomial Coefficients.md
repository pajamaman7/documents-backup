Multinomial coefficients are a method of [[Counting]] where we count the number of ways to partition $n$ distinct objects into $k$ distinct groups where each object appears in exactly one group.

Suppose we have $n$ total objects going into $k$ groups, where each contains $n_1,n_2\ldots$ objects

The number of ways to do this, after simplification, becomes:

$$N=\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\ldots n_k!}$$
