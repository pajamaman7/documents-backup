Polar coordinates take the $xy$ plane as represented with [[Cartesian Coordinates]] and show them in terms of an angle $\theta$ from the positive $x$-axis and a distance $r$ from the origin.
In general, to convert from cartesian to polar, 
$$\begin{align} x&=r\cos\theta \\ y&=r\sin\theta \end{align}$$
In some cases, it may be useful to represent [[Complex Numbers]], [[Multiple Integrals]], and much more in polar coordinates, as certain properties of exponentials and integrals can make for much simpler algebra.
