Covariance and Correlation tell us how related two data points are. Covariance gives us only whether the two datasets are related, positively or negatively, while Correlation scales the result to the [[Variance and Standard Deviation]] of the data, allowing us to judge the strength of the relation.

The formulas are given as follows: 
$$COV[X,Y]=E[XY]-E[X]E[Y]$$
and
$$COR=\frac{COV[X,Y]}{\sigma_x\sigma_y}$$
