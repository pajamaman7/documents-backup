(From [[Discrete Probability Distributions]])
A Binomial Distribution occurs when an event has two outcomes, success and failure, with probability of success $p$, over $n$ trials.

A single-trialed binomial distribution is called a Bernouli Trial.

The [[Probability Mass Function]] is given by:
$$P(X=x)= {n\choose x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$$
The [[Expected Value]]:
$$\mu=np$$
The [[Variance and Standard Deviation]]:
$${\sigma_x}^2=np(1-p)$$
