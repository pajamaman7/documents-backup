The Chi-square Distribution is one of our [[Continuous probability distributions]], a special case of the [[Gamma Distribution]] with $\alpha=\frac{\nu}{2},\beta=2$. We call $\nu$ the Degrees of Freedom. $\chi^{2}$ is right-skewed and its distribution is given by:
$$\frac{1}{2^{\nu/2}\Gamma\left( \frac{\nu}{2} \right)x^{\nu/2}-1}e^{-x/2}$$
Its [[Expected Value]]:
$$E[X]=\nu$$
And [[Variance and Standard Deviation]]:
$$V[X]=2v$$
