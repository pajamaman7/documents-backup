[[Lagrange multiplier]]s can be used to find the extrema for $f(x,y)$ (or $f(x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_n)$) subject to a constraint $g(x,y)=c$. This method will allow us to find extrema on the boundary. 

## The Method
Find all places where $\nabla f = \lambda\nabla g$ for a nonzero real $\lambda$ (called the [[Lagrange multiplier]]) and evaluate $f$ at all of them.
So we will have a system: 
$$\begin{align*} \nabla f(x,y)&=\lambda\nabla g(x,y)\\
g(x,y)&=c\end{align*}$$
which must be solved entirely with trickery, algebra and case work.
