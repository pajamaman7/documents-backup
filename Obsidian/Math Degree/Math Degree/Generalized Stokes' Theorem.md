If $\omega$ is a [[k-forms]] in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with $k=0,1,2$, then 
$$\int_{D}^{}  \, d\omega =\int_{boundary(D)}^{} \omega $$
where $D$ is a curve or surface as appropriate.
[[Divergence Theorem]], [[Stokes' Theorem]], and the [[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]] all follow from this fact.
- For a 0-form, this is the FTC
- For a 1-form, this is Stokes'
- For a 2-form, this is Divergence Theorem
