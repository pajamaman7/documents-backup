$GF(p^{n})$ is the unique [[Finite Fields|Finite Field]] of order $p^{n}$.
## Theorem 
- If $K$ is a subfield of $GF(p^{n})$ then $K=GF(p^{m})$ with $m|n$.
- If $m|n$ there is exactly one subfield of $GF(p^{n})$ of order $p^{m}$ consisting of the roots of $x^{p^{m}}-x$.
## Underlying Multiplicative Group
The group $F\setminus \{ 0 \}$ under multiplication is cyclic for Galois/finite fields.
Generators for this group are called Primitive Elements.
### Corollary
The Galois field of order $p^{n}$ is the [[Field Extensions|Field Extension]] $\mathbb{Z}_p(u)$, where $u$ is a primitive element of $GF(p^{n})$. There exists an irreducible $f\in \mathbb{Z}_p[x]$ of degree $n$.
