Reminder that [[U(n)]] is the set:
$$U(n)=\{[a]\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}: GCD(a,n)=1\}$$
We denote 
$$\Phi(n)=\left| U(n) \right| $$
and call this [[Euler's Totient Function]]. This counts the number of coprime integers up to but not including $n$.
We can write that if  $GCD(a,n)=1$: 
$$a^{\phi(n)}\equiv 1\pmod{n}$$
Note that for a prime $p$, $\phi(p)=p-1$. This gives us [[Fermat-Euler-Theorem]].
