Let P and Q be statement variables.
## Symbols
The symbol “∀” means “for all” or “for any”.
The symbol “∃” means “there exists” or “for some”.
## Proving Statement types
- If P, then Q -or- $\forall P, Q$ 
    - Suppose that P is true.
    - Prove that Q is true.
- ∃ x P(x) such that Q 
    - Choose x so that P(x) is true.
    - Prove that Q is true.
∗∗You do not need to explain how you find x, nor do you need to try to construct all
possible x.
## Proving false statements
To prove that a statement is false, you must write out the negation of the statement
and prove that.
## Common Mistakes
1. You cannot: suppose that the conclusion (what you are trying to prove) is true.
2. You should not: overuse symbols nor violate the rules of grammar.†
† You must write in full sentences and use symbols correctly.
• When proving a statement of the form (2) “∀ P, Q”:
3. You cannot: “choose” or exhibit an example in place of a proof.
• When proving a statement of the form (3) “∃ x P(x) such that Q”:
4. You should not: attempt to construct all possible x so that P(x) and Q are
true.
• When proving a statement by contradiction (see below):
5. You cannot: claim a contradiction has been reached without explanation.††
†† You must clearly identify the contradiction being made by making a statement
of the form “P and NOT P, which is a contradiction”.
## Cases and Contradiction
Proof by Cases. To prove: “If P1 or P2 or P3, then Q.” Use cases.
Proof.
Case 1: Suppose P1. Prove Q.
Case 2: Suppose P2. Prove Q.
Case 3: Suppose P3. Prove Q.

## Proof by Contradiction
Proof.
Suppose NOT Q.
Obtain a contradiction.
Conclude Q.
