A Geometric Distribution is a special case of the [[Negative Binomial Distribution]] where $r=1$. In other words, what is the probability of the $y$th trial being the first success.

The [[Probability Mass Function]]:
$$p(y)=(1-p)^{x-1}p$$
The [[Expected Value]]:
$$E[X]=\frac{1}{p}$$
The [[Variance and Standard Deviation]]:
$$\sigma^2=V[X]=\frac{1-p}{p^2}$$
