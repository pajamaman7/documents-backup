The Central Limit Theorem states that the sample mean, when considered with its own distribution, is approximately normally distributed (provided $n>25$).
$$\bar{x}\sim norm(E[\bar{x}],\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})$$
This is true regardless of the distribution of $\bar{x}$. It can be continuous, discrete, etc.
