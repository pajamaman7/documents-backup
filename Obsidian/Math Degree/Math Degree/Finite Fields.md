[[Fields]] of size $p$ can be given simply as $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Fields of size $p^{n}$ can be generated by $\frac{\mathbb{Z}_p[x]}{\left< g \right>}$ where $g\in \mathbb{Z}_p[x]$ has degree $n$, and $g$ is irreducible. Then the [[Ideals|Ideal]] $\left< g \right>$ is prime, and the quotient is a field. In fact any finite field has order $p^{n}$. 
## Characterization of finite fields
If $F$ is a finite field, then $F$ has $p^{n}$ elements, $char F=p$ prime and $n\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$
In particular, $char F=p$ means $pa=0$ for any $a\in F$, and then $F\supseteq\mathbb{Z}_p$, and it is a [[Vector Spaces|Vector Space]] over $\mathbb{Z}_p$.
### Consequence of Prime Characteristic
If $char F=p$ then the mapping $\sigma:F\to F$ is a ring homomorphism. This is not true in a general ring or field since $\sigma(a+b)\neq\sigma(a)+\sigma(b)$. However if $char F=p$, then $p|{p\choose k}$ and by [[Binomial Theorem]] we get the identity.
### As Splitting fields
Write $f(x)=x^{p^{n}}-x$
- ? Any $|F|=p^{n}$ is a splitting field for $f$
- Any splitting field of $f(x)$ over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ has order $p^{n}$.
- $f$ has no repeated roots
## Derivative over finite fields
Let $f(x)=a_{0}+a_{1}x+\dots+a_nx^{n}$. Then we define $f'(x)=a_{1}+2a_{2}x+\dots na_nx^{n-1}$. This satisfies our typical [[Rules for Derivatives]].
### Characterization of repeated roots
For $f(x)\in F[x]$:
- $(x-a)^{2}|f(x)$ if and only if $x-a|f'(x)$ and $x-a|f(x)$
- If $f(a)=0$ then $(x-a)^{2}|f(x)\iff f'(a)=0$
