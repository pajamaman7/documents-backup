Let $R$ be a [[Rings|Ring]]. Then the polynomial ring of $R$ is:
$$R[x]:=\{ a_nx^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+a_{1}x+a_{0}:a_i\in R,n\geq 0 \}$$
Addition is defined by:
$$(a_{0}+b_{0})+(a_{1}+b_{1})x+\dots$$
and multiplication is messy with much expansion. A trick:
Coefficients of $x^{k}=\sum\limits_{i+j=k }^{}a_ib_j$.
A polynomial $f\in R[x]$ is called *monic* if the leading coefficient is 1.
## Theorem
If $R$ is a domain:
- $R[x]$ is a domain
- If $f(x),g(x)\neq 0$, then $\deg(fg)=\deg(f)+\deg(g)$
- Units of $R[x]$ are precisely units in R.
## Division Algorithm
In any polynomial ring, [[Euclid's Recursive Algorithm]] holds. 
If $f(x),g(x)\in R[x]$ so that the leading coefficient of $f(x)$ is a unit in $R$, then there exists $q(x),r(x)\in R[x]$ so that $g(x)=f(x)q(x)+r(x)$ and $0\leq\deg(r)<\deg(f)$
### Corollary
If $\alpha \in R$ is a root of a polynomial $f(x)$, $f(\alpha)=0$, then $\exists g(x)\in R[x]$, $f(x)=g(x)(x-\alpha)$.
If no such $\alpha$ exists, we say that the polynomial is irreducible. 
## Irreducible Polynomials
Where $K$ is a field, $0\neq f(x)\in K[x]$ is called irreducible if:
- $\deg f\geq 1$
- $f(x)=g(x)h(x)$ means $\deg g=0$ or $\deg h =0$.
So, linear polynomials are irreducible.
## Theorem
Suppose $R$ is a [[Domain (Algebra)|Domain]]. Let $f(x)\in R[x]$, nonzero, and $\deg(f)=n\geq 0$. Then $f$ has at most $n$ roots in $R$.
## Rational Root Theorem
See [[Rational Numbers]].
Let $f(x)=a_0+a_{1}x+\dots+a_nx^{n}$ be a polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. $\frac{r}{s}\in \mathbb{Q}$ is a root of $f(x)$ if $r|a_{0}$ and $s|a_n$.
If $f$ is monic, the only rational roots are integers.
## Coefficients in a field
If K is a field, then any ideal of $K[x]$ is a principal ideal.
One can show that an ideal is prime if it is generated by an irreducible polynomial,
and that this ideal is also maximal.
