Let $M$ denote an abelian group (written additively).If $R$ is any ring, we say that $M$ is a left $R$-module if, for any $r\in R$ and $x\in M$, an element $rx\in M$ is defined such that the following conditions hold for all $x, y\in M$ and all $r,s\in R:$
- $r(x+y)=rx+ry$
- $(r+s)x=rx+sx$ 
- $r( sx) = ( rs) x$
- $1x= x$
