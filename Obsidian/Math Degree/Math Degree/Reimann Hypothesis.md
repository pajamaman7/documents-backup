The Riemann Hypothesis considers the [[Reimann-Zeta Function]] given by: 
$$\zeta(s)=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^s}$$
(With $s\in\mathbb{C}$)
The hypothesis states that all the (non-trivial) zeroes of the function lie on the line $\Re\{s\}=\frac{1}{2}$. The first $10^{14}$ zeroes have been verified.
