Let $G$ be a [[Groups|Group]] with a subnormal series
$$ G=G_{0}\trianglerighteq G_{1}\trianglerighteq\dots\trianglerighteq G_n=\{ e \} $$
We call $G$ solvable if, for any $i=0,1,\dots,n$ $G_i / G_i+1$ is abelian.
Solvable groups are used extensively in [[Galois Theory]].
### Construction for Solvable Series
Let $G$ be a group. The Derived Series for $G$ is constructed as follows:
Let $G'$ be the [[Commutator Subgroup]] of $G$, $G'=\{ [a,b]:a,b\in G \}$. Recall this is normal and the quotient is abelian. (In fact, $G_i\trianglelefteq G$ for any $i$, under this construction.)
Let $G=G_{0},G'=G_{1},G''=G_{2},\dots$. Then clearly the series:
$$
G_{0}\trianglerighteq G_{1}\trianglerighteq \dots\trianglerighteq G_n
$$
is a solvable series provided $G_n=\{ e \}$.
### Theorem for solvable groups
A group $G$ is solvable $\iff G_n=\{ e \}$ for some $n\geq 1$.
