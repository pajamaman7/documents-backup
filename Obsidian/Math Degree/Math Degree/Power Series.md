(From [[Sequences and Series]])
Power series are infinite sums of a polynomial usually in the following form: 
$$\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}(x-c)^n$$
Where x is a variable, and c is the point at which the function is centered around.
We can use the [[Root and Ratio test]] to find the [[Radius]] of the power series, which is the range of $x$ values where the series converges.
$$(x-c)\lim_{n\to\infty}\left | \frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}\right | = L$$
When the limit $L$ is less than 1, the series converges.
Power series can be the only way to represent certain functions or integrals, and are the only way for computer systems to approximate values for functions like $ln(x)$ or $sin(x)$.

When we use a power series to represent a specific function, we call it a [[Taylor Series]].
