A CW Complex, or a Cell Complex, is an iteratively generated topological space. It is generated as follows:
- $X^{0}$ is a discrete set, with finitely many points
- $X^{1}$ is obtained by gluing copies of $D^{1}$ between the specified points;
	- $X^0$
## Theorem
If $X$ is a [[Countable and Uncountable sets|Finite]] CW Complex, and $A$ is a finite subcomplex, then $(X,A)$ has the [[Homotopy Extension Property]]
### Property
A finite cell complex is locally contractible
