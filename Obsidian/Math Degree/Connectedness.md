Let $X$ be a [[Topology|Topological Space]]. A separation of $X$ is a pair of disjoint nonempty open sets in $X$, whose union is $X$. If no such separation exists, $X$ is said to be connected.
## Metric Spaces
In a [[Metric Spaces|Metric Space]] $X$, two nonempty sets $A,B$ are said to be separated when $\bar{A}\cap B=\varnothing=A\cap \bar{B}$. 
If $E$ cannot be written as the union of two non-empty separated sets, $E$ is connected
### Continuity
If $f:X\to Y$ is continuous, and $E\subseteq X$ is connected, then $f(E)$ is connected in $Y$.
