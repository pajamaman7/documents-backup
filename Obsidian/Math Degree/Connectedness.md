Let $X$ be a [[Topology|Topological Space]]. A separation of $X$ is a pair of disjoint nonempty open sets in $X$, whose union is $X$. If no such separation exists, $X$ is said to be connected.
## Metric Spaces
In a [[Metric Spaces|Metric Space]] $X$, two nonempty sets $A,B$ are said to be separated when $\bar{A}\cap B=\varnothing=A\cap \bar{B}$. 
If $E$ cannot be written as the union of two non-empty separated sets, $E$ is connected
### Closures
If $Y$ is connected in $X$, and $B,C$ form a separation of $X$, then $Y$ must be entirely within $B$ or $C$.
### Unions
Closure is preserved under union; if $A_\alpha$ is a connected family of sets in $X$, then $\bigcup\limits_{\alpha }^{}A_\alpha$ is connected in $X$.
### Continuity
If $f:X\to Y$ is continuous, and $E\subseteq X$ is connected, then $f(E)$ is connected in $Y$.
### Cartesian Product
A finite [[Cartesian Product]] of connected spaces is connected.
