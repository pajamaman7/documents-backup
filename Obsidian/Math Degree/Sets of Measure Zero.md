If $N\subseteq X$ is a subset of a [[Measure|Measurable Space]] , with $\mu(N)=0$, $N$ is said to be a set of measure zero.
## "Almost Everywhere"
As general as the phrase "Almost everywhere" might sound, it has a precise formulation. We say that a property $P$ holds almost everywhere in $E$ if the set $N$ where $P$ fails has measure zero in $E$.
