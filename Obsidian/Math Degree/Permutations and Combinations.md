Permutations and Combinations allow for counting different ways to choose or permute objects.

## Factorial
A factorial of $n$ gives the number of ways to order $n$ objects. It is given by:
$$n!=\prod_{i=1}^{n}i=n\times n-1\times\ldots\times2\times1$$
Or, the product of all the numbers from 1 to $n$.
## Permutations
Permutations count the number of ways to choose and order a set of $k$ objects from a set containing $n$ objects. This is given by:
$$nPk = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$
## Combinations
Combinations  count the number of ways to choose a set of $k$ objects from a set of $n$ objects. In this case, order is irrelevant.
$${n\choose {k}}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$
Note that:
$${n\choose k }=\frac{nPk}{k!}$$
