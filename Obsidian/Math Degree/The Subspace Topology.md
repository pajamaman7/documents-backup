Let $X$ be a [[Topology|Topological Space]] with a [[Topology]] $\mathcal{T}$. Then for a set $Y\subseteq X$, the set
$$ \mathcal{T}_Y=\{ Y\cap U: U\in\mathcal{T} \} $$ is a topology for $Y$ called the subspace topology. We also say that $Y$ is a subspace of $X$.
We can generate a basis for this topology:
$$ \mathcal{B}_Y=\{ Y\cap B:B\in\mathcal{B} \} $$
## Theorem
Let $Y\subseteq X$ be an open subspace. If $U$ is open in $Y$, then $U$ is open in $X$.
## Theorem
If $A$ is a subspace of $X$ and $B$ is a subspace of $Y$, the the topology inherited from the product $A\times B$ is identical to the topology inherited from the subspace topology $A\times B\subseteq X\times Y$
