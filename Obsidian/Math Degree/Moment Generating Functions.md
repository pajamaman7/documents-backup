A [[Moment]] is a numerical measure that defines a [[Probability Mass Function]]. They can describe characteristics of the shape of $p(x)$.

A Standardized moment is centered at $0$, while a Centralised moment is centered around $\mu$.

The First Standardized moment is the [[Expected Value]].
The Second Centralised moment is the [[Variance and Standard Deviation|Variance]]. 
The Third Centralised moment is the [[Skewness]].
The Fourth Centralised moment is the [[Kurtosis]].
## Finding MGF - Continuous
The $k^{th}$ standardized moment of a random variable $X$ is given by
## Finding moment - Discrete
The $k^{th}$ standardized moment of a random variable $X$ is given by:
$$E[{X}^k]=\sum_{allx}x^kP({X}=x)$$
The $k^{th}$ centralised moment of a random variable $X$ is given by:
$$E[(X-\mu)^k]=\sum_{all\cdot x}(x-\mu_x)^kP({X}=x)$$
