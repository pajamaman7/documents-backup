## Process
- Equate the first sample raw moment $M_1^{\prime}=\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^nX_i^1=\bar{X}$ to the first theoretical moment $E(X).$
 - Equate the second sample raw moment $M_2^{\prime}=\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^nX_i^2$ to the second theoretical moment $E(X^2).$
 - Continue equating raw sample moments, $M_k^{\prime}$, with the corresponding theoretical moments $E(X^k),k=3,4,...$ until you have as many equations as you have parameters.
-  Solve for the parameters.
## Alternate
- Equate the first sample moment about the origin $M_1^{\prime}=\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^nX_i^1=X$ to the first theoretical moment $E(X).$
 - Equate the second sample central moment $M_2^*=\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar{X})^2$ to the second central theoretical moment $E((X-\mu)^2).$
 - Continue equating sample central moments, $M_k^*$ with the corresponding central theoretical moments $\bar{E}((X-\mu)^k),k=3,4,...$ until you have as many equations as you have parameters.
-  Solve for the parameters.
### Definitions
- $\mu_k^{\prime}=E(X^k)$ is the $k^{th}$ (theoretical) raw moment of the distribution (about the origin), for $k= 1, 2, \ldots$
 - $\mu_k^*=E[(X-\mu)^k]$ is the $k^{th}$ (theoretical) central moment of the distribution (about the mean)
 - $M_k^{\prime}=\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^nX_i^k$ is the $k^{th}$ raw sample moment, for $k=1,2,\ldots$
 - $M_k^*=\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar X)^k$ is the $k^{th}$central sample moment (about the mean), for $k=1,2,\ldots$
