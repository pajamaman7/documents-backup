Improper integrals are integrals where one or both of the bounds is infinite. For some function $f(x)$,
$$\int_{0}^{\infty}f(x)dx$$
We can solve the integral by subsituting a parameter $t$ for the infinite bound(s) and then taking the limit to infinity. (suppose that $F(x)$ is the antiderivative of $f$).
$$\int_{0}^{\infty}f(x)dx=\lim_{t\to\infty}\int_{0}^{t}f(x)dx=\lim_{t\to\infty}F(t)-F(0)$$
