A path in a [[Topology|Topological Space]] $X$ is a [[Continuity|Continuous]] map $f:I\to X$. It has a start point $f(0)$, and an endpoint $f(1)$.

## Path Homotopy
A [[Homotopy]] of paths $f,g$ is a map $H:I\times I\to X$, so that 
- $H(x,0)=f(x)$ and $H(0,s=f(s))$
TODO
## Loops
If $f(0)=f(1)$ for a path $f$, we say that $f$ is a loop
