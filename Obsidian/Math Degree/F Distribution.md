Let $X\perp Y$ be independent $\chi^{2}$ distributed random variables with $\nu,\delta$ degrees of freedom respectively. Then:
$$F=\frac{\frac{X}{\nu}}{\frac{Y}{\delta}}$$
And we have 
$$E[F]=\frac{\delta}{\delta-2}$$
When $\delta>2$;
$$V[F]=$$
## F-Distribution and Sample Variance
The use for F-distributions comes from:
$$\frac{S_{1}^{2}\sigma_{2}^{2}}{S_{2}^{2}\sigma_{1}^{2}}\sim F(n_{1}=1,n_{2}=1)$$
(Degrees of freedom are determined by the sample sizes of our two input distributions).
## T and F distributions
$$T^{2}\sim F_{1,n-1}$$
