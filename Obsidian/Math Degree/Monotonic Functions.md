## Monotonic Functions
A function is monotonically increasing if $x<y\implies f(x)<f(y)$
A function is monotonically decreasing if $x<y\implies f(x)>f(y)$
A function is called monotonic if it is either monotonically increasing or decreasing.
### Theorem
If $f$ is monotonic on $(a,b)$, then $f(x+)$ and $f(x-)$ exist for all $x \in(a,b)$.
#### Corollary
- Monotonic functions can only have discontinuities of the first kind (jump)
### Theorem 
If $f$ is monotone on $(a,b)$, then the points of discontinuity of $f$ in $(a,b)$ are [[Countable and Uncountable sets|At most Countable]].
