Let $X$ a [[Topology|Topological Space]], with $X=U_{1}\cup U_{2}$ open, each [[Connectedness|Connected]] and $U_{1}\cap U_{2}$ connected. If $p \in U_{1}\cap U_{2}$, we can compute the fundamental group of $X$ through the fundamental groups of $U_{1},U_{2}$. In particular,
$$
\pi_{1}(X)\cong(\pi_{1}(U_{1})*\pi_{1}(U_{2})) / \pi_{1}(\ker f)
$$
where $f$ is the unique map generated by the [[Free Product of Groups|Free Product]].
