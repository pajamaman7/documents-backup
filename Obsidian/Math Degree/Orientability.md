## Topologically
A [[Topology|Topological Space]] is orientable if there is a consistent definition of "clockwise" and "counter-clockwise"
## Surfaces (Manifolds)
A surface $S$ is orientable if its normal vector $\vec{n}$ describes a smooth vector field defined on $S$. An orientable surface has two sides. Which side is chosen gives the orientation of the surface.
#### Example
An orientable surface with no edge nor hole is called Closed (ex. egg, sphere).
A Mobius strip is an example of a non-orientable surface.  
## Boundary curve
The chosen orientation of $S$ produces an orientation (direction of travel) on each boundary curve. This orientation is said to be positive if when travelling along the curve with our heads pointing in the direction of $\vec{n}$, the surface $S$ is on our left.
