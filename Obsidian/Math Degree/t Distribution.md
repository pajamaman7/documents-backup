If $Z$ is a standard normal random variable, and $W$ is a $\chi^{2}$ random variable with $\nu$ degrees of freedom. If $Z\perp W$, let 
$$T=\frac{Z}{\sqrt{ \frac{W}{\nu} }}$$
The PDF is given by:

And:
$$E[T]=0\quad V[T]=\frac{\nu}{\nu-2}$$
We use this distribution when we have information about $S^2$, [[Sample Variance]] but not population variance.

$$T=\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\frac{S}{\sqrt{ n }}}$$
