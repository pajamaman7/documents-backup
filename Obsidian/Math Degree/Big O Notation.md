## Primitive operations
Each of the following operations takes the same amount of time on a given machine:
- Assigning a value to a variable
- Following an object reference
- Arithmetic operation
- Comparing variables/numbers
- Accessing array index
- Calling a method
- Returning from a method
## Growth rates
We measure an algorithm's time requirement as a function $f$ of the input size $n$. We observe the amount the time requirement of an algorithm grows as $n$ increases.
