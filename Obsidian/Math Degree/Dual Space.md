Let $V$ be a [[Vector Spaces|Vector Space]], not necessarily [[Vector Spaces|Finite Dimensional]]. The set of linear maps $V^{*}=\mathcal{L}(V,\mathbb{C})$ is called the dual to $V$. This forms its own vector space. Maps in this space are called [[Dual Space|Functionals]].
## Theorem
If $V$ is finite-dimensional, then $\dim V=\dim V^{*}$. Otherwise the cardinality of $V^{*}$ may be much larger than $V$.
## Dual Basis
Let $\{ b_{1},\dots,b_n \}$ a basis for $V$. Define the functionals: $\delta_i(b_j)=\delta_{ij}$. These form a basis for $V^{*}$.
