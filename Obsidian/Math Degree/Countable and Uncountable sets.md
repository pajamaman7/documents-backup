Let $X$ be a set, and write $X\sim A$ if there exists a [[Bijection]] from $X$ to $A$. We can classify $X$ in one of the following ways:
- $X$ is finite if $X\sim \mathbb{Z}_n$
- $X$ is infinite if $X$ is not finite
- $X$ is countable if $X\sim \mathbb{Z}^{+}$
- $X$ is uncountable if $X$ is neither countable or finite.
- $X$ is at most countable if it is finite or countable.
### Subsets
Let $A$ be a countable set. Then any infinite $E\subseteq A$ is also countable.
### Sequences
Let $\{ E_n \}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of countable sets. Then $S=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}E_n$ is countable.
