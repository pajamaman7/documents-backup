A function $f: D\to \mathbb{C}$, $D$ open is called analytic if for any $c\in D$, we can find $D'(c,r)\subseteq D$ such that:
$$f(z)=\sum\limits_{n=0 }^{\infty}a_n(z-c)^{n}$$
for any $z\in D'(c,r)$.
Analytic functions are of class $C^{\infty }$; [[Differentiation of Complex Functions|Holomorphic]].
To check if $f(z)$ is analytic, we check if we can write a power series for it around any point $c$.
### Equivalent definitions
- $f(z)$ can be reconstructed in a open disc around any point in $D$ with its [[Taylor Series of Complex Variable|Taylor Series]].
- The [[Taylor Series of Complex Variable|Taylor Series]] of $f(z)$ about $c$ converges to $f(z)$ not just at $c$ but in an open disc around $c$.
