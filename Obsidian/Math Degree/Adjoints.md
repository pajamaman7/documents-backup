## For $M_{mn}(\mathbb{C})$
We define $A^{*}=[\overline{a_{ji}}]$ for $A=[a_{ij}]$
For the [[Inner Product Space|Inner Product]] $\left< x,y \right>= \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}x_j\bar{y}_j$, we may now write this as $y^{*}x$.
### With an inner product
And, $\left< Ax,y \right>=\left< x,A^{*}y \right>$.
## For general inner product spaces
Suppose $V,W$ are [[Vector Spaces|Finite Dimensional]] [[Inner Product Space|Inner Product Spaces]]. For any $T:V\to W$, there is a unique [[Linear Operators|Linear Map]] $T^{*}:W\to V$, satisfying 
$$ \left< Av,w \right> _W=\left< v,A^{*}w \right> _V $$
## Unitary Operator
A unitary operator is one with $TT^{*}=I$
## Isometry
An isometry is a linear transformation that preserves the norm; $\| Tv \|=$
