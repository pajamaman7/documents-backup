Let $f:X\to\mathbb{R}$ be a real function defined on a [[Topology|Topological Space]] $X$. $f$ is said to be upper semicontinuous if:
$$
U=\{ x:f(x)<\alpha \}
$$
is open for every $\alpha$.
Likewise, $f$ is lower semicontinuous if:
$$
L=\{ x:f(x)<\alpha \}
$$
is open for every $\alpha$.
If $f$ is both upper and lower semicontinuous, then $f$ is [[Continuity|Continuous]].
