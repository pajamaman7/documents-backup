If $X$ is a [[Ordered Set|Simply Ordered Set]], then there is a topology on $X$ generated by each of the bases 
$$ \mathcal{B}_1=\{ (a,b):a,b\in X \} $$
$$ \mathcal{B}_2=\{ [x_{1},b):a,b\in X \} $$
$$ \mathcal{B}_3=\{ (a,x_{2}]:a,b\in X \} $$
With $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$ the least and greatest elements of $X$ respectively.
## Rays
Sets of the following types are called rays:
$$
\begin{align}
(-\infty ,a)&=\{ x<a:x\in X \}\\
(a,-\infty )&=\{ x>a:x\in X \}\\
(-\infty ,a]&=\{ x\leq a:x\in X \}\\
[a,-\infty )&=\{ x\geq a:x\in X \}
\end{align}
$$
The first two are called open rays, and since they are open sets in $X$ with the order topology, they form a subbasis of $\mathcal{B}_1$ above.
