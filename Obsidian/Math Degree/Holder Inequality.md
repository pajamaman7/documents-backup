If $p>1$ and $q$ is such that $\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}=1$, then for any $x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_n$ and $y_{1},y_{2},\dots,y_n$ all in $\mathbb{R}$,
$$ \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}|x_j||y_j|\leq\left(\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}|x_{j}|^{p}\right)^{1/p}\left(\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}|y_{j}|^{q}\right)^{1/q} $$
This is an extension of the [[Cauchy-Schwarz]] Inequality, which is identical for $p=q={2}$
Another consequence of this inequality is the proof of the [[Minkowski Inequality]]
