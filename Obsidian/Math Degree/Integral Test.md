(From [[Convergence tests]])
The Integral test takes an infinite series and represents it as an indefinite integral. So, if $f(x)$ is continuous, positive, and decreasing on $[k,\infty)$, and $f(n)=a_n$, then: 
$$\int_{k}^{\infty}f(x)dx
\quad \text{diverges}\iff \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}a_n\quad\text{diverges}$$
