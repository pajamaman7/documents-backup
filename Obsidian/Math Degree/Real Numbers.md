## Constructions
Given the set $\mathbb{Q}$ of [[Rational Numbers]], we have several constructions which can produce the reals, with the desired properties.
### By cuts
By Dedekind, we define $x\in\mathbb{R}$ as a subset of $\mathbb{Q}$ which is:
- Unbounded below (or above if we so choose)
- Not empty or equal to $\mathbb{Q}$
- If $p\in x$, then $\forall q<p$ in $\mathbb{Q}$, $q\in x$.
- For any $p\in x$, there is another $q\in x$ greater than $p$.
Then, we define addition and multiplication:
### By Cauchy Sequences
