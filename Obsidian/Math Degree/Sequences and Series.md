Sequences and series is the middle section of [[Calculus II]], as well as having much to do with [[Proof by induction]].
A sequence is defined as a discrete collection of numbers, seperated by commas. Take the following Fibonacci series.
$$\{1,1,2,3,5,8,13\ldots\}$$
The nth term of this sequence can be found by adding the two previous terms together     
($a_n = a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}$) for all $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ , $n\geq2$. where $a_1=a_2=1$.

A series can be defined as the sum of all the terms of a sequence up to some value. This is notated as: 
$$\sum_{n=0}^{k}a_n$$
In Calculus, most series will be taken to infinity, and we will use [[Convergence Tests]] to determine whether they diverge or converge, but we will not necessarily find what values they might converge to. Some series are dependent on a variable and can be use to represent a function $f(x)$. These are called [[Power Series]], or a [[Taylor Series]] when considered as the representation of a function

Other types of series include [[P-Series]] and [[Geometric Series]].
