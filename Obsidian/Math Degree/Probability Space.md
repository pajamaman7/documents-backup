A probability space is a [[Measure|Measurable Space]] $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$:
- $\Omega$ is the sample space, the set of all possible outcomes
- $\mathcal{F}$ is the $\sigma$-[[Algebra]] of $\Omega$, the set of all events we like to consider
- $P$ is a [[Measure]] on $\Omega$, with $P(\Omega)=1$, and $P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)$ whenever $A\cap B=\varnothing$, $A,B$ are disjoint.
