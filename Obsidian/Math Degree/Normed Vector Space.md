A $\mathbb{C}$-[[Vector Spaces|Vector Space]] together with a norm, which is a $\|\cdot\|:V\to\mathbb{R}$ satisfying:
- $\|v\|\geq 0$ and $\|v\|=0\iff v=0$
- $\|\alpha v\|=|\alpha|\|v\|$ for any $\alpha \in\mathbb{C}$
- $\|v+w\|\leq\|v\|+\|w\|$
Such a space is called a normed vector vector space.
## IP space
Every [[Inner Product Space]] has a norm $\|\cdot\|=\sqrt{ \left< v,v \right> }$. This norm is said to be *induced* by the inner product.
## Metric Space
Given a normed space $X$, we can define a metric $d(x,y)=\| x-y \|$, so that $X$ is a [[Metric Spaces|Metric Space]]. $d$ is called the metric induced by $\| \cdot \|$.
## Parallelogram Law
For an inner product space $V$, we have 
$$
\| v+w \| ^{2}=2\| v \| ^{2}+2\| w \| ^{2}
$$
