For a [[Countable and Uncountable sets|Finite]] [[CW Complex]], $X^{0}\subseteq X^{1}\subseteq \dots\subseteq X$, which is path-connected, and $p \in X$; we have:
- $\pi_{1}(X^{0})=0$
- $\pi_{1}(X^{1})=\langle g_{1},\dots,g_h \rangle$ 
- $\pi_{1}(X^{2})=\pi_{1}(X^{1}\cup_\alpha D^{2}_\alpha) =\langle g_{1},\dots,g_h \rangle / \langle r_{1},r_l \rangle$  where $r_i$ are generated [[Relations]] by normalizer of some set TODO
- $\vdots$
- $\pi_{1}(X^{n-1})\cong\pi_{1}(X^{n})$
