## Motivation
We have seen $\pi_{1}(X)=[S^{1},X]$. While the [[Fundamental Group]] is a valuable tool, it is not enough for us to understand $X$ up to [[Homotopy]].
### Attempted Generalization of $\pi_{1}$
Define:
$$
\pi_n(X)=[S^{n},X] $$
These are difficult to compute in practice.
## Homology
Homology is a "linearization" of $\pi_n$. It can:
- Distinguish $S^{n},S^{m}$ for $n\neq m$
- Vanish above the dimension of a [[CW Complex|Cell Complex]]
- Good formal properties for computation
## $n$
