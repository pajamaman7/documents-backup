Dear Brianna:

\bigskip

Please accept this letter as a formal notice of my resignation from my position as Store Guide with Breathe Outdoors.

\bigskip

My last scheduled shift is May 31st. I enjoyed my four years at Breathe and I would like to thank you, Craig, and so many staff for their mentorship and support.  I will take skills and friendships with me. 

\bigskip

I would also like to take this opportunity to request a letter of recommendation to be used in my ongoing academic and employment pursuits. 

\bigskip 

I wish you and Breathe Outdoors continued success, and will be forever a happy camper.

\bigskip

Sincerely,\\
Thomas Boyko
