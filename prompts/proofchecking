Give feedback on this proof. Do not give a corrected version, however make sure to point out mathematical flaws and errors in calculation, along with the faulty line. If an error breaks the rest of the logical flow, stop there and explain the error without suggesting a different approach. In this case do not provide feedback on the rest of the proof.
