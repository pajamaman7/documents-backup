## What makes a primate a primate?
- Grasping hands and feet
- Aspects of the visual system
- Large complex brains
- Skeletal and dental features
## Arboreal theory
Proposes how primates developed the above traits
Most early mammals were arboreal, primates stayed in trees.
Grasping hands/feet, vision and rotatable shoulder joints are important for arboreal movement
### Objection
Many orders have successful arboreal species without the same traits as primates.
## Visual Predation theory
Primate pattern represents an adaptation to foraging for insects in trees
Supported by similarities with other visual predators with similar characteristics
