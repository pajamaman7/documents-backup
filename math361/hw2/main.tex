\begin{prob}{Q1}
Let $S$ be a subset (not necessarily a subspace) of a finite dimensional inner product space $V$. Show that $(S^\perp)^\perp = \text{span } S$, where
$$\text{span } S := \left\{\sum_{j=1}^m \alpha_j s_j : \alpha_j \in \mathbb{C}, s_j \in S, m \in \mathbb{N}\right\}$$
is the smallest subspace of $V$ containing $S$ (think of this as the set of all possible linear combinations of vectors from $S$).
\end{prob}
\paragraph{Solution: } Write $E=\text{span}\, S$, and let $\{b_1,\ldots,b_n\} $ be a basis for $E^{\perp}$.
\begin{align*}
    v\in E&\iff 
.\end{align*}

\begin{prob}{Q2}
Let $V$ and $W$ be finite dimensional inner product spaces and suppose $\ker A = \{0\}$. Find a left inverse for $A$ in terms of $A$ and $A^*$.
\end{prob}
\paragraph{Solution: } Begin with the identity,
\[ \{0\} =\ker A =\ker A^* A .\] 
So the composition of transformations $A^* A:V\to V$ has zero kernel and is injective, and by rank-nullity it must too surjective. Then this map is invertible, and if we take $(A^* A)^{-1}A^* A=I$, we see that $(A^* A)^{-1}A^* $ is a left inverse for $A$.

\begin{prob}{Q3}
Let $V$ be a finite dimensional inner product space.
\begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*)] 
\item We can think of any $x \in V$ as a linear map from $\mathbb{C} \to V$ by setting $x(\lambda) := \lambda x$. You do not have to prove that this is linear. Show that $x^*: V \to \mathbb{C}$ satisfies
$$x^* y = \langle y, x\rangle.$$
Use this to deduce that the map $xy^*$ is given by $xy^* v = \langle v, y\rangle x$.
HINT: The inner product on $\mathbb{C}$ is assumed to be $\langle z, w\rangle = z\overline{w}$.
\item Show that if $T: V \to \mathbb{C}$ is any linear map, then there is a vector $y$ so that $T = y^*$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}{Q4}
Let $V$ and $W$ be finite dimensional vector spaces. You may find problem 3 useful here.
\begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*)] 
    \item Suppose $T: V \to W$ satisfies $\text{rank } T = 1$. Show that there are vectors $x \in W$ and $y \in V$ so that $T = xy^*$.
    \item Suppose $T: V \to W$ satisfies $\text{rank } T = k$. Show that $T$ is the sum of $k$ rank one operators. Hint: $PT = T$ where $P$ is the orthogonal projection onto $\text{ran } T$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}{Q5}
Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are unitarily equivalent $n \times n$ matrices. That is, there is a unitary matrix $U$ so that $U^*AU = B$. Show that $E$ is an invariant subspace for $B$ if and only if $UE$ is invariant for $A$.
Recall that a subspace $E$ of $V$ is invariant for $T$ if $Tv \in E$ for all $v \in E$.
\end{prob}
