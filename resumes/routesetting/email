Hi Juan,

I was told by some of my coworkers at Chinook that I should send over my resume since you might be looking for setters over the summer. I'd really appreciate the opportunity to meet with you and discuss how I could fit into the team at SoCal. I'd love to be a part of what makes SoCal such a great gym. Attached is my resume, and if you would like any other references or information, I'd be happy to provide it.

Looking forward to working with you,
Thomas
